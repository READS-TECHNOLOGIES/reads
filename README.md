# $READS – Study to Earn Tokens

## Overview

$READS is a **Learn-to-Earn educational platform** that transforms studying into real economic value.  
Instead of learning without incentives, $READS rewards users with **$READS tokens** for genuinely studying educational content and passing structured quizzes.

The platform is built around **exam-focused learning** (JAMB, WAEC, IELTS, SAT, etc.) and uses a **secure CBT-style quiz engine** to ensure that rewards are earned through real effort — not shortcuts.

> Learn 📖 → Prove Knowledge 🧠 → Earn Tokens 💰

## What Problem $READS Solves

Millions of students:
- Lack motivation to study consistently
- Cannot afford quality exam preparation tools
- Spend hours learning with no tangible reward

Most existing EdTech platforms:
- Are paid-only

- Offer no economic incentive for learners

**$READS changes this** by making learning both **accessible and rewarding**.

2. User studies a lesson (time tracked)
3. User takes a CBT-style quiz
4. System validates learning behavior
5. User earns $READS tokens if they pass fairly
6. Tokens can be used inside the ecosystem

## Anti-Cheat System (Token Farming Protection)

To protect the platform and token economy, $READS includes **multi-layer anti-cheat logic** designed specifically to prevent **token farming**.

### 1. Admin-Controlled Quiz Configuration

Admins define:
- Question pool size (e.g. 10 questions)
- Questions shown per attempt (e.g. 3 random)
- Token reward amount (50, 100, 200 tokens)
- Minimum passing score (70%, 80%, etc.)
- Cooldown time between attempts

This prevents uncontrolled reward distribution.

---

### 2. Random Question Selection 🎲

- Each quiz attempt pulls **random questions** from a larger pool
- Question order and answer order are randomized
- Leaving and retaking a quiz generates **new questions**
- No fixed or predictable quiz pattern

This blocks memorization, sharing, and automation.

---

### 3. Copy & Interaction Protection 🛡️

To stop answer extraction:
- Text selection is disabled
- Right-click and context menus are blocked
- Copy attempts are detected and flagged

This prevents copying questions for external use.

---

### 4. Time & Behavior Tracking ⏱️

Learning behavior is validated using time thresholds:

**Lesson Engagement**
- Minimum lesson read time (e.g. 30 seconds)
- Quizzes cannot be taken immediately

**Quiz Interaction**
- Minimum time per question (e.g. 3 seconds)
- Impossibly fast completions are flagged

Fast or unnatural attempts are invalidated.

---

### 5. Rate Limiting 🚦

To prevent automated farming:
- Cooldown between quiz attempts (default: 30 seconds)
- Daily quiz limits (20–30 max)
- Hourly quiz limits (10 max)

These limits ensure fair usage and system stability.

---

### Reward Validation Logic

Tokens are issued **only if all conditions are met**:

✔ Lesson engagement verified  
✔ Quiz completed naturally  
✔ Minimum pass score achieved  
✔ No anti-cheat flags triggered  
✔ Rate limits respected  

If **any check fails**, no tokens are awarded — even if answers are correct.

---

## Why This Matters

The anti-cheat system ensures:
- Honest learners are rewarded
- Bots and farmers are blocked
- Token supply remains sustainable
- Certificates and results remain credible

$READS rewards **knowledge, not exploitation**.

---

## Vision
